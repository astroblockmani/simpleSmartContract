To test, use `truffle test`

To run the project, use `npm start` from within frontend directory. You will need static server installed. You can install this by using `npm i -g static-server`.

If you want to redeploy, from the root, use `truffle develop` and then `migrate --reset`. Remember, you will need to replace the contract ABI and contract address in bundle.js
